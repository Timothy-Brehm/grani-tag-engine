# Engine Composition Model

**Living document.** This describes how to build games on `grani-tag-engine` using entities, tags, traits, pools, and actions. If a design argument stalls because these rules are wrong or incomplete, update this file (and `.cursor/rules/engine-composition.mdc`) instead of overriding them in code.

This doc is **game-agnostic**. It must remain useful for a colony game, a wizard crafting game, a life sim, or something else—without baking in any one theme’s content.

## Purpose of the engine

The engine owns **serializable game facts and transitions**:

- what exists (entities)
- what is true about them (tags → traits / capabilities)
- what they hold (pools)
- what can happen (actions / future processes)

Hosts own **presentation**: UI, layout, art, panels, input bindings.

If a change only affects how something looks or is clicked, it belongs in the host. If it changes rules, requirements, or outcomes, it belongs in engine state and commands.

## Core vocabulary

### Entity

An **entity** is anything that can own tags, pools, and offered actions: a person, a workstation, a spellbook, a shop, a career track card, a cauldron, a colony lander.

| Concept | Engine shape |
|---------|----------------|
| Identity | stable `id` (instance) + `definitionId` (type) |
| Catalog | `EntityDefinition` (initial tags/pools, actions, spawn limits) |
| In play | `EntityInstance` in `EngineState.entities` |
| Spotlight | optional `primaryEntityId` (usually the primary character) |

**Composition rule:** prefer many entity *definitions* with shared mechanics over inheritance hierarchies. Presentation differences stay in the host registry.

**Primary entity:** first-class pointer for the **primary character** (the avatar the human player controls). Hosts may default the action **actor** to it; the engine does not assume React or a character sheet. Prefer display labels like “You” / a renamed name in the host—not renaming the technical definition id to `Character`.

### Speaking clearly (hosts + agents)

| Term | Means |
|------|--------|
| **Player** | Human at the keyboard |
| **Character** | Any in-game character entity |
| **Primary character** | Entity referenced by `primaryEntityId` |

Correct loose speech when “player” means the avatar.

### Tag

A **tag** is a named declarative fact on an entity (unique by name per entity). Tags carry passive **effects** that *derive* traits and capacities.

Examples of tag *names* (illustrative only): `knows-firebolt`, `has-mortar-and-pestle`, `career-barista-tier-2`, `discovery-lichen-fiber`.

Tags are not the UI label and not the inventory row by themselves—they are the rule-layer fact.

**Prefer adding tags to removing them.** Model state transitions as accretion (or successor tags), not erasure of history.

| Prefer | Avoid (when either works) |
|--------|---------------------------|
| `found_crate` → also grant `opened_crate` | `found_crate` → remove `found_crate` |
| `emergency_supplies` → `emergency_supplies_opened` | Clear the only tag that recorded the crate existed |
| Gate “already done” on the *new* tag | Gate on absence of the old tag after deletion |

Removing a tag (or entity) is allowed when something truly leaves play and nothing should hang off the old fact—but default to **grant the next fact** so history, requirements, and metrics remain queryable. Host presentation can hide or restyle based on the new tag without deleting the old one.

### Trait (lasting quantity or flag)

A **trait** is a lasting property used for gating and progression. Traits are **not spent** when used as requirements (contrast with pools).

Today the engine derives numeric traits from tag passive effects of type `stat` (field `stat`). Boolean “capability categories” may be modeled as tag presence or as dedicated attribute effects—refine as games need it.

| Trait style | Meaning | Typical use |
|-------------|---------|-------------|
| Quantity trait | Strength 3, Arcana 2, Charisma 1 | Requirements (`stat` ≥ N); never spent by the check |
| Presence trait | “has Power Generation”, “knows Herbalism” | Requirements (`tag` exists / not) |

**Design rule:** if something has a quantity but is not consumed by actions, it is a trait—not a pool.

### Pool

A **pool** is a spendable (or fillable) quantity with a **current** value and a **maximum**.

| Piece | Engine shape |
|-------|----------------|
| Current | `entity.pools[poolId]` |
| Maximum | derived from tag effects `pool-max` (field `pool`) |
| Change | `adjust-pool` effect / command (clamped to max) |

Pools model stamina, ingredients on hand, money, mana, stress, reputation points—anything that goes up and down and has capacity.

**Storage as progression:** raising `pool-max` is a meaningful unlock when actions require stockpiles.

### Action (recipe)

An **action** is one atomic recipe:

1. **Requirements** — may it be offered / started?
2. **Costs** — what is paid (usually pools, sometimes tags)?
3. **Results** — what is produced?
4. **Side effects** — optional extras after results

Actions are data (`ActionDefinition`). Execution is `execute-action` with roles:

| Role | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Actor** | Who pays costs / receives default effects (often primary entity) |
| **Source** | Whose action list / context this came from (workbench, NPC, spellbook) |
| **Target** | Optional affected entity |

Defaults today: costs/results lean **actor**; presence checks for source-owned facts lean **source**.

### Process (reserved)

A **process** will be a standing allocation that attempts an action once per tick (automation / jobs). Prefer processes that **reuse the same actions** the player runs manually. Not fully implemented yet; do not invent idle minting as a substitute unless the game explicitly wants it.

### Metrics (tracked quantities for gates and effects)

**All meaningful metrics should be tracked** in engine-owned state so requirements and effects can hang off them—not only “current” gameplay values the UI happens to show.

Metrics live on each **entity** (`entity.metrics`):

| Metric family | Storage | Why track it |
|---------------|---------|--------------|
| Action counts | `actionCounts[actionId].{manual,automatic,total,firstTick,lastTick}` | Unlock after N crafts; when first/last run |
| Pool current | live `pools` + metric req `pool-current` | Gates, effects, UI |
| Pool high-water | `poolHighWater` + `poolHighWaterAtTick` | “Once held 50 rock”; when it peaked |
| Pool low-water | `poolLowWater` + `poolLowWaterAtTick` | “Ever hit 0 Life”; when it bottomed |
| Pool lifetime used | `poolLifetimeUsed[pool].{amount,firstTick,lastTick}` | Lifetime spent (not current stock) |
| Pool-max high-water | `poolMaxHighWater` + `…AtTick` | Storage milestones |
| Trait / stat water | `statHighWater` / `statLowWater` + `…AtTick` | Trait peaks / floors |
| Tag first granted | `tagGrantedAt[tagName]` | Age / “held for N ticks” (kept after remove) |
| Entity / spawn | `spawnCounts` / active counts on engine | Caps and “have ever built” |
| Tick / time | `EngineState.tick` | Total game time; `engine-tick` / `tag-held-for` gates |

**Time model:** prefer **engine ticks**, not wall-clock, for metrics and requirements (deterministic, pause-safe, saveable). Hosts may present `tick / ticksPerSecond` (e.g. `/ 1000`) as “seconds” if they advance ticks at a fixed rate. Wall-clock belongs in host telemetry/UI only—do not hang rules on `Date.now()`.

**Wiring today:**
- High/low-waters refresh whenever tags or pools change; `*AtTick` records the engine tick of the last change.
- Tag grants record `tagGrantedAt` on first sight (not cleared on remove).
- `adjust-pool` adds **actual** decreases to `poolLifetimeUsed` with first/last ticks.
- `execute-action` increments actor action counts with first/last ticks; pass `execution: 'automatic'` for processes.
- Builtin requirement `{ type: 'metric', metric: '…', amount, … }`:
  - most metrics: value `>= amount`
  - `pool-low-water` / `stat-low-water`: value `<= amount`
  - `engine-tick`: `EngineState.tick >= amount`
  - `tag-held-for`: tag present and `tick - tagGrantedAt >= amount`

**Rules of thumb:**
- If a designer might later say “when X has happened N times / reached N,” it should be a metric—not reconstructed from logs.
- Prefer **monotonic counters and high-water marks** alongside live values; do not rely on deleting tags to infer history.
- Distinguish **manual vs automatic** action execution so automation does not silently satisfy “player did this” gates unless intended.
- Metrics are engine facts: hosts may display them; hosts should not be the only place they live if rules need them.

### Novelty (“new” badges — saveable)

**Intent:** when something new appears for the player, the engine remembers it until the host acknowledges it (so saves keep ⚠ state). Presentation (badge art) stays in the host.

Constant: `NOVELTY_AUTO_SEEN_TICKS = 30` (pool/stat auto-clear after that many **shown** ticks; ≈30s when the host advances 1 tick/sec).

| Kind | Becomes new when | Cleared when |
|------|------------------|--------------|
| **Entity** | Spawns / enters play with `entitySeen: false` | `seen-entity` (or bootstrap seed) |
| **Action** | Action id is **on the entity’s offered list** (definition actions at spawn; later dynamic adds) — even if greyed out / unavailable | `seen-action` |
| **Pool / stat** | First appears on the entity (pool key / derived stat) | `seen-pool` / `seen-stat`, **or** auto after `NOVELTY_AUTO_SEEN_TICKS` while the sheet reports it shown |

**`hasNew` (derived):** `!entitySeen || any unseen offered action || any unseen pool/stat`.

**Bootstrap (starting loadout):** do **not** treat default entities as new. Prefer marking them fully seen immediately after create (`markEntityNoveltySeen` / `seen-all` helper)—no content-definition “createdSeen” flag unless we later need it often.

**Sheet shown ticks:** host dispatches a per-tick “this entity’s pools/stats are on the character sheet” signal while that entity is selected; engine accumulates shown ticks and auto-marks pools/stats seen at the constant. Do not use wall-clock.

**Rule for future object kinds:** any new engine-facing object type the player can discover should get novelty + seen (same pattern as actions/pools). Metrics already follow “track for gates”; novelty follows “surface until acknowledged.”

**Host presentation:** badge (prefer ⚠ triangle) on entities/actions/pools/stats from selectors; click/open sends the matching `seen-*` command.

## How pieces combine

```text
EntityDefinition
  ├─ initialTags  →  traits (stat/…) + pool maxima
  ├─ initialPools →  starting currents
  └─ actions[]    →  recipes offered when this entity is source

Action
  ├─ requirements →  read traits/tags/pools/metrics/entity counts (scoped)
  ├─ costs        →  adjust-pool / (rarely) remove facts (actor by default)
  ├─ results      →  grant-tag / adjust-pool / spawn-entity / …
  └─ sideEffects  →  same toolbox, applied after results

EntityInstance
  └─ metrics → actionCounts + pool/stat high-waters

EngineState
  ├─ entities + spawnCounts
  ├─ primaryEntityId?
  └─ tick
```

**Recipe graph:** unlocking is usually `grant-tag` or `spawn-entity` or raising `pool-max`, which then satisfies requirements on other actions. Prefer expanding that graph over special-case code paths.

**Host layer:** maps definition ids to views (card, sheet, map pin, dialogue). Multiple views may share one entity (e.g. primary-character card + status sheet).

---

## Builtin toolbox (current)

**Requirements:** `free`, `forbidden`, `tag`, `stat`, `pool-max`, `entity-count`, `metric`  
**Effects:** `grant-tag`, `adjust-pool`, `spawn-entity`, `remove-entity`

Hosts may register namespaced types when a game needs a true special case—but try a recipe first.

---

## Canonical patterns (how to combine pieces)

These are the patterns we intend to reuse. Names can be thematic; the structure should stay stable.

### 1. Stacking quantity trait — Science (as used today)

**Intent:** a lasting quantity that gates requirements and is **not spent**. Multiple sources stack.

**Composition:**
- Each source is a **tag** whose passive effect is `{ type: 'stat', stat: 'Science', strength: N }`.
- Examples: `Item_WristComputer_Science` (+1), `Item_ScienceKit_Science` (+1).
- Trait value = sum of matching `stat` strengths on the entity (today: primary character).
- Requirements use `{ type: 'stat', stat: 'Science', amount: 2 }` (scope actor).
- Acquiring gear is usually `grant-tag` of that item tag (idempotent by name—each unique gear tag once).

**Do not** model Science as a pool unless you want it consumed.

### 2. Capacity + consumption — Computer RAM

**Intent:** usable capacity with a spendable current (programs loaded, buffer used, etc.).

**Composition:**
- Pool id `RAM` on the relevant entity (primary character or a `computer` entity).
- Max from tags: e.g. `Module_Baseboard_RAM` → `{ type: 'pool-max', pool: 'RAM', strength: 8 }`; upgrade stick `Module_DIMM_8G` adds another +8 via another tag.
- Current in `pools.RAM` (how much is in use, or how much free—pick one convention and keep it).
- **Load program** action: requirements `pool-max` / free current; costs `adjust-pool` RAM by −size (if current = free) or +size (if current = used).
- **Unload** reverses the adjust.
- Clamping ensures you cannot exceed installed max.

Same pattern as Life/Stamina: **max from tags, current from pool, change via adjust-pool.**

### 3. Stockpiles with multiple capacity sources — Rock (+ bins + backpack)

**Intent:** one resource (`Rock`) with capacity contributed by several containers; backpack also expands other resource caps.

**Composition:**
- Single pool id `Rock` on the stockpile owner (often primary character or a `camp` entity)—**one current**, one logical resource.
- Capacity tags stack `pool-max` for `Rock`:
  - `Storage_Base_Pile` (+20)
  - `Storage_Extra_Bin_1` (+50)
  - `Storage_Extra_Bin_2` (+50)
  - `Storage_Backpack` (+10 Rock **and** +10 Herb + +10 Ore via multiple effects on the same tag)
- Crafting “Extra Bin 1” is an action whose result is `grant-tag` `Storage_Extra_Bin_1`.
- Gathering rock is `adjust-pool` Rock +N, clamped to summed max.

**Rule:** prefer **one pool per resource type** with many capacity tags, not separate Rock pools per bin (unless bins are separate entities that can be stolen/destroyed independently—then each bin entity has its own Rock pool and UI aggregates).

### 4. One-shot interactable — Emergency crate (use once)

**Intent:** something is available, the player (or primary character) uses it once, and that history stays queryable. Host may hide or restyle it afterward.

**Composition (prefer tag accretion):**
- Fact on lander/source (or crate owner): start with `found_crate` (or spawn with that tag).
- Appearance: tag the **host** reads (`appearance-charred-crate`), or definition `cardImage` if static. Prefer a tag if appearance can change.
- Action (crate or lander as **source**, primary character as **actor**):
  - Requirements: has `found_crate`, **does not** have `opened_crate` (or require `opened_crate` absent)
  - Results: `grant-tag` `opened_crate`, grant loot tags on actor, optionally change appearance tag (`appearance-empty-crate`)
- **Do not** default to removing `found_crate` to mean “opened.” Keep both; gate repeat use on `opened_crate`.
- Optional: if the board must drop a physical card, host may `remove-entity` the crate **instance** while the lander keeps `found_crate` + `opened_crate`. Prefer leaving an entity when later effects might hang off it.

**Appearance trait:** e.g. tag `appearance-damaged` → host picks sprite. Engine stores the fact.

### 5. Advancement stage + mutually exclusive path picks

**Intent:** large content gated on a stage tag; entering the stage requires choosing exactly one specialization.

**Composition:**
- Gate content with requirement `{ type: 'tag', tagName: 'major_stage_colony', exists: true }` (on primary character or colony entity).
- **Enter stage** might be automatic when prerequisites met, or an action that only offers **three exclusive choices**:
  - `Choose Fishing Village` → results: `grant-tag` `major_stage_colony`, `grant-tag` `path_fishing_village`, and grant-tags or removals that **forbid** the others (e.g. grant `path_locked` alternatives, or remove the competing choice actions by replacing a chooser entity).
  - Same for `path_hunting_village`, `path_mining_village`.
- Practical exclusive pattern:
  1. A temporary `stage-chooser` entity offers the three actions.
  2. Each action grants stage + path tags, then `remove-entity` on the chooser (choices vanish with the entity).
  3. Downstream recipes require `major_stage_colony` plus optionally a specific `path_*` tag.
- Deepening a path unlocks path-specific recipes; shared colony recipes need only `major_stage_colony`.

## Worked sketches (not product specs)

These show composition only. Names are fictional.

### Wizard game

| Design idea | Composition |
|-------------|-------------|
| Wizard | Primary character entity; traits Arcana, Will; pools Mana, Satchel |
| Reagents | Pools on wizard or on a `satchel` entity (`moon-petal`, `iron-salt`) |
| Learned spell | Tag on wizard (`spell-firebolt`) granting presence or Arcana-related effects |
| Spellbook / altar | Source entity offering cast/craft actions |
| Cast Firebolt | Requirements: tag `spell-firebolt`, Arcana ≥ 1, Mana ≥ 2; costs Mana; results: grant-tag on target or spawn effect entity |
| Brew draught | Source = cauldron; actor = primary character; costs reagents; results grant-tag or potion pool |
| Mastery | New reagents / schools via discoveries (tags), not only +% mana regen |
| Familiar automation | Future process: familiar entity allocates “gather reagent” action each tick |

### Life sim

| Design idea | Composition |
|-------------|-------------|
| Person | Primary character; traits Charm, Focus, Strength; pools Energy, Money, Stress |
| Skill ranks | Quantity traits or tier tags (`skill-barista-2`) from career actions |
| Job board / workplace | Source entity with shift actions |
| Take a shift | Costs Energy; results Money; may grant-tag career progress |
| Unlock career | Requirement on tags/traits from prior jobs; result grant-tag or spawn workplace entity |
| Education | Actions that trade Money/Energy for traits |
| Life stage | Stage tags; choices grant exclusive path tags (same pattern as village picks) |
| Roommate / shop | Other entities; primary character is actor, shop is source |

Both games use the **same** engine nouns: entities, tags→traits, pools, actions, roles. Theme lives in definitions and host presentation.

## Decision guide

| Question | Prefer |
|----------|--------|
| Is it spent when used? | **Pool** |
| Lasting quantity for gates, not spent? | **Trait** (`stat` / future attribute) |
| Boolean unlocked fact / category? | **Tag** presence (or presence trait) |
| State change / “used up” / phase change? | **Grant a successor tag** (keep prior tags when useful) |
| Something that can be selected, located, or owned separately? | **Entity** |
| One-shot player or NPC verb? | **Action** |
| Repeats every tick while assigned? | **Process** (when implemented) |
| “Has this ever / how many times / how high?” | **Metric** (count or high-water), not host-only memory |
| Only changes pixels / layout? | **Host presentation** |

## Agent / PR checklist

- [ ] Named using engine vocabulary (entity / tag / trait / pool / action / process / metric)
- [ ] Recipe-shaped when possible (requirements → costs → results)
- [ ] Prefer grant successor tags over removing tags for state transitions
- [ ] Metrics considered if counts / high-waters could gate future content
- [ ] Actor / source / target roles explicit when more than one entity is involved
- [ ] Host vs engine boundary respected (no React in core; no rule logic only in UI)
- [ ] Works as a pattern for more than one genre (not smuggling one game’s nouns into the core API)
- [ ] If this doc blocked a good design, the doc was updated

---

## Non-goals

- Engine knowing cards, character sheets, maps, or dialogue trees
- Inheritance trees of entity *classes* instead of definitions + tags
- Putting updater functions or React setters into serializable state
- Genre-specific builtins (`astrevno/…`, `wizard/…`) inside the core package when a generic recipe would do
- Relying on tag deletion or host-only counters as the only history of what happened
